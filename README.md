V/U/SHF and QO-100 SDR Transceiver Project

This project is a SDR receiver transceiver project initiated to have a portable QO-100 Satellite ground station which can receiver on 739 MHz (direct output of a standard TV LNB) and transmit on 2.4 GHz QO-100 uplink frequency.
The basic idea of the SDR is based on Arjante Marvelde's implementation of Guido's uSDX implementation on raspberry pi pico (https://github.com/ArjanteMarvelde/uSDR-pico/).

Instead of HF components as Tyloe detector Analog Devices's IQ modulator and demodulator chips are chosen to be the IQ components.

I will update the documentation as soon as possible.
